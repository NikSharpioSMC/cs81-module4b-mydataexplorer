Analyzing Maya's Data Journal...

Most screen time: Wednesday (8 hrs)
Average sleep: 6.9 hrs
Most frequent mood: "productive"
Does more caffeine mean better focus? â†’ Nope!

Reflection:
I thought caffeine helped me focus, but I was actually most focused on days with low caffeine.

Write at least 4 functions that explore your data. Example names:

findHighestScreenTime()
averageSleep()
mostFrequentMood()
correlateCaffeineToFocus()
*/

// Function to calculate the average sleep hours
